<div class="textblock"><p><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md0"></a>A minimalist wrapper around the Vulkan API to write easy, portable, and (somewhat) safe compute shaders in C!</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Why was this made?</h1>
<p>I wanted a compute shader to parallelise one of my projects, it was meant to run on a super-computer, so I needed something portable, fast, and able to run without a window, so Vulkan was the best choice. Sadly I'm not very experienced with Vulkan, and I would've had a hard time transferring my whole algorithm to it. So I made this side project that automatically manages variables, memory, and the pipeline, so I could focus on the algorithm itself.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
Advantages</h1>
<ul>
<li>Very easy to use, and doesn't require much code to get started. I would say it's about as hard as CUDA, so quite easy if you have a basic understanding of parallel programming.</li>
<li>Fast &amp; Portable, because so is Vulkan.</li>
<li>Error handling and checking, if you want, there are automatic memory checks, that you can enable or disable, which prevents basic mistakes like writing to a variable that doesn't exist, or not finding the shader file, or Vulkan not being supported. All of that without needing to mess with Validation Layers.</li>
<li>Can also be used with C++</li>
<li>No need to create a window, or use a library like GLFW, it's meant to be used without a window, and it's very lightweight.</li>
<li>Can work with any shader language you like, I chose GLSL in the examples simply because it's the closest to C in terms of syntax </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Disadvantages</h1>
<ul>
<li>Not very flexible, as it's meant to be simple, it doesn't support many features of Vulkan, and it's not meant to be used for complex graphics, only for compute shaders.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Should I use this?</h1>
<p>If all you need is to send data to the GPU, make it do some calculations, and get the results back, then it's perfect. For example : doing operations on very large arrays, matrices and so on... However, if you need to do more complex operations, you should use Vulkan directly, or a wrapper with more features.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
How can I use it?</h1>
<p>A basic program will look like this :</p><ul>
<li>Step 1: Init the Culkan instance with <code>culkanInit</code>, which takes a shader binding layout, and a shader file.</li>
<li>Step 2: Write to the variables through the bindings with <code>culkanWriteBinding</code>.</li>
<li>Step 3: Finish the setup with <code>culkanSetup</code>.</li>
<li>Step 4: Run the shader with <code>culkanRun</code>.</li>
<li>Step 5: Read the results with <code>culkanReadBinding</code>.</li>
<li>Step 6: Free the resources with <code>culkanDestroy</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's quite simple, and definitely less verbose than Vulkan.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>A C compiler</li>
<li>Vulkan libraries</li>
<li>GPU drivers that support Vulkan Should be able to run on any OS with these requirements, I tested it on Linux with an AMD GPU (Manjaro, AMD Lucienne).</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Miscelaneous</h1>
<p>I am a bit stupid, so if the code is a bit stupid, that's why. Clang tidy is mad at me for a few reasons, I'll have to fix that. FIXME The casing and naming style may change in the future, because I'm not sure on if I want to follow Vulkan's naming style or dissociate from it, but it shouldn't be too bad to change it in your code if you ever use this. I promise I will do better documentation and examples in the future, and clean up some stuff. But I don't want to be too off-schedule with my main project. I learned a bit about Vulkan, so that's cool. If this is useful to you, then I'm happy :D </p>
